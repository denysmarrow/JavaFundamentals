    3. Function - A Block of code that performs a task. contains methods and classes, objects
    4. Field -

    5. Variable - temporarily store information in the computers memory
    there are different types of variables

    6. Interpreted and Compiled languages - intelliJ is using the java compiler to compile
    our code into a different format called Java Byte Code. Java runtime enviornment then
    has the Java Virtual Machine that turns our code in Native Code which can be interpreted
    on various platforms. This is why Java is platform independent.

    -Integers- a type of variable that use whole numbers only
    -Primitive Types - for storing simple values
        -byte
        -short
        -int
        -long - all for storing whole numbers^^^^^^
        -float - can store decimals
        -double
        -char - single character
        -boolean - true/false

    Non-Primitive / Reference Types- complex values
        - dates, messages
        they do not store actual objects. they are used as reference
        and store the address or reference to the object
